# Adopt a Pet
Adopt a Pet is an Android app for pet adoption powered by [Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/), that I have mostly as a sample project.

# WIP 
This is currently a WIP, but the architecture and some basic functionality are mostly done, such as searching for Pets and opening the details screen of a pet. The most noticeable pending implementation should be the UI.
