# Adopt a Pet
Adopt a Pet is an Android app for pet adoption powered by [Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/), that I have mostly as my main sample project, although I might also use it as a playground for doing some experiments. 

## WIP 
This is currently a WIP that doesn't have yet the minimum features and code quality that I intend it to have.

## Architecture [WIP]
Mostly based on [The Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) by Uncle Bob, and the [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) from Google.
